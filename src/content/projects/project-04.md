In this gripping thriller, a chance rescue on a remote Georgia island unravels a conspiracy that reaches the highest levels of power and wealth in America. 

When retired Navy SEAL Jack Reeves discovers Linda Washington washed ashore on his private island—the sole escapee from a human trafficking operation—he has no idea their paths crossing will ignite a dangerous quest for justice. Together with Jack's cousin Marcus, a skilled con artist with a moral compass, they uncover a shocking truth: a beloved television personality, Vanessa Moore, and influential Senator William Preston are secretly running one of the largest human trafficking networks in North America. 

As Jack, Marcus, and Linda orchestrate an elaborate scheme to bring down these powerful criminals, they find themselves aided by a mysterious operative whose identity remains hidden even from them. Their plan: create an elaborate financial trap, drain the traffickers' offshore accounts, and expose their crimes to the world. 

But in a world where wealth buys protection and influence secures immunity, conventional justice isn't enough. When their targets attempt to escape accountability, fate delivers a twist that brings a symmetry to justice no courtroom could provide. Meanwhile, family secrets long buried begin to surface, connecting the unlikely allies in ways none of them could have imagined. 

"Crooked Idols" explores the dark underbelly of power and privilege, the resilience of survivors, and the sometimes murky line between justice and vengeance. This pulse-pounding thriller examines how far someone will go to protect family, what true justice looks like for victims of unspeakable crimes, and the unexpected ways our pasts can collide with our present.
